/*Find all the Prime Numbers in a Given Interval in Java
Given two integer inputs for the range or the interval for the search.
The objective is to search and find all the Prime Numbers that lay in the given interval or range.
To do so we’ll iterate through the numbers and check whether or not they are prime simultaneously. We’ll use loops to check whether the number has any factors other than 1 and the number itself.
Here are few methods we’ll use to Find all the Prime Number in a Given Interval in Java Language. */

/*For two integer variables lower and higher we perform the following,

We run a loop  to iterate through the number in the given interval.
We check if the number is a prime by checking for factors within the range. */
